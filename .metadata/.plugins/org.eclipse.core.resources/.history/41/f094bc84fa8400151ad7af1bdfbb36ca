Answers to questions from lab.

2. [Explain times for java HashTesting test1].

airbears2-10-142-39-195:experiments Nirvana$ java HashTesting test1 /usr/share/dict/words 1
Strings from /usr/share/dict/words, skip=1:
	Added 235886 items and checked 235886 items in 0.1 seconds (0.00023 msec/string)
airbears2-10-142-39-195:experiments Nirvana$ java HashTesting test1 /usr/share/dict/words 2
Strings from /usr/share/dict/words, skip=2:

skip 2 is supposed to be faster. However even without skipping, it runs really fast already.
So it has not significant between the two hashing.


3. [Explain times for java HashTesting test2 and test3].

airbears2-10-142-39-195:experiments Nirvana$ java HashTesting test2 2000
Strings xxyy: Added 4000000 items and checked 4000000 items in 3.4 seconds (0.00043 msec/string)
airbears2-10-142-39-195:experiments Nirvana$ java HashTesting test3 2000
Strings xXyY: Added 4000000 items and checked 4000000 items in 5.1 seconds (0.00064 msec/string)




4. [Why does HashSet fail to work in java HashTesting test4?]
when the input is not upper case, the constructor does not convert the letters to upper case.

5. (Optional) Explain how ListTesting program demonstrates that LinkedLists are doubly linked.
